I stayed for four nights while attending a conference . The hotel is in a great spot - easy walk to Michigan Ave shopping or Rush St. , but just off the busy streets . The room I had was spacious , and very well-appointed . The staff was friendly , and the fitness center , while not huge , was well-equipped and clean . I 've stayed at a number of hotels in Chicago , and this one is my favorite . Internet was n't free , but at $ 10 for 24 hours is cheaper than most business hotels , and it worked very well .
we love the location and proximity to everything . The staff was very friendly and courteous . They were so nice to our 2.5 year old boy . got his backpack full of goodies the moment we arrived . We got free wifi and morning drinks by signing up for select guest program . Ca n't beat that ! the only minor issue is the elevator . we have to take 2 separate elevator trips to get to our room . It got a little annoying when we were going in and out often . Otherwise , it was a great stay !
I want to issue a travel-warning to folks who might sign up for the weekend deal they offer through travelzoo from time to time : The deal says `` free breakfast '' included in the price . However , what they do n't tell you , is that the breakfast consists of a cup of coffee and a bisquit ( or two ) ! Moreover , you need to ask for these `` tickets '' at the lobby when you check in - they wo n't give them to you automatically ! We stayed there over Christmas '03 , and we , and I noticed several guests who bought the same package , had a rather unpleasant experience ! The hotel is nice though , if you do n't consider their lousy service !
Just got back from three nights at the Knickerbocker . Went up to Chicago for some last minute Christmas shopping . Hotel is in a great location . North end of Michigan Ave. about half a block away . Staff was very nice and professional . Everyone we came in contact with was very helpful . Granted this is a older hotel and some of the rooms are no bigger than closets . We were booked into a standard room and when we arrived we upgraded to a deluxe room . Good size room , with nice furnishings and a comfortable bed . Bathroom was somewhat small . Housekeeping did a great job cleaning the room every day . Did not eat at the restaurant Nix , but saw several people getting orders delivered to the bar . Overheard comments saying the food was very good . Drink service at the Martini Bar can be slow . Martinis run $ 9 and up . Very good drinks and they do n't shy away from the liquor . Valet parking was $ 35 a day with in/out priviliges . Overall a great stay . Would definately stay at this hotel in the future .
My family and I stayed at this hotel during an extended weekend trip in July , 08 . We had ( 3 ) 1 bedroom suites . Great Location in downtown Chicago . Within walking distance to shopping and most downtown tourist attractions . The service was excellent and the hotel staff was friendly . The breakfast buffet was very good but the eating area can get crowded . I recommend going early . The rooms were quiet and clean . I highly recommend this hotel for families and for travelers staying > 2-3 days . We would stay here again . Parking is expensive , about $ 28/day . It is valet . The cheapest self parking I could find in the area was $ 24/days so we did valet parking . The valet and bell staff were very helpful and friendly . This is my 3rd experience with Homewood Suites ( 3 different cities ) . I have had a great experience each time .
i valeted my lexus and it was returned with a smashed side mirror . They admitted it was their fault , and now they wo n't pay the $ 500 to fix it because we ca n't prove it was not broken before ! ! ! the hotel is wonderful , the rooms are new and nice , but we will never stay here again because of this ... .Be sure to inspect your car before you leave !
great expectations from the hotel of THE FUGITIVE ! Wonderful lobby ! AND THAT 'S IT ! The room was old in style and furnitures , the tv was from the other century , no minibar , no wireless internet , no wireless adapter enough for the number of the room , those guys ignore that we are in the era of IPAD without cable connections . small room , small bathroom , rude service room . they have lost my credit card number and want CASH ON DELIVERY for a breakfast of 20 dollars . Robbery in the business center , 0,59 cents a MINUTE for internet connection , you have to pay to use word , or excel . NEVER AGAIN !
Named my price on priceline . $ 50.00 Bucks . Hotel room was great . Clean , Clean and new . Fresh crisp sheets , comfortable bed , flat screen TV , clean carpet , nice bath , etc . Short distance to food and sightseeing . I highly recommend this property . Be prepared to pay over $ 40.00 per night to park . Hey , Its a hyatt . They also charge $ 5.00 for a bottle of water that is normally a buck . For a total of $ 100.00 nightly stay in Chicago this place is it just do n't drink the bottled water . Happy Travels
I never write these reviews , but felt that it was important to state that this hotel should not be the # 1 2008 travelers choice . Terrible Service , Lazy Doormen/bellmen/concierge/valet , Lack of Respect , allow dogs to bark all morning after multiple complaints , Phantom charges to room , front dest at checkout and checkin were pompus . The icing on the cake was me watching the doormen stand and watch while a father tried to open a door to push his stroller through with his infant son , and the doorman watched on doing nothing . Me and my girlfriend are young , look young in how we dress , but in all honesty make more money than most ... and we were treated like cheap poor kids . I had dinner reservations at Spaiggia and wanted to order a car to pick us up , the concierge exclaimed that , `` You know its not jeans and running shoes right Mr . Blank ? '' Assuming I was too dumb to realize that a 5 star $ 200/person restraunt wont allow tennis shoes because I am young ? Very Dissapointed . Very nice looking , comfortable beds , great room service , contemporary , younger crowd , but service was terrible .
My husband and I stayed here for three nights while visiting Chicago as tourists . What a beautiful hotel ! Our room was lovely , the staff was super helpful and the location was convenient . They do n't have an in house gym , but each day you can get a day pass to a cushy gym down the street . The restaurant in the hotel has a very yummy breakfast . The concierge helped us to make dinner reservations at the last minute our first night there . We were able to walk down the Magnificent Mile from our hotel , as well as through the Gold Coast and Old Towne neighborhoods . There are tons of great restaurants in the area ( including the famous Gibsons and the Signature Room in the Hancock tower ) as well as lots of shopping . There is currently a lot of construction going on near the Talbott ( they are building condos right behind it ) , but regardless we had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay there again when visiting Chicago .
This is my second time here in two months ; both stays were great . The rooms are very nice and very clean . The staff is terrific and always attentive . My only concern would be there never seems to be anyone at the concierge desk .
If I did n't have to stay here , I would n't . Without exception , I swear I am not lying , every day of my stay brings a new problem . Over the past 3 months , I have stayed here 6 times for 3 nights at a time ; problems every time . From the wrong food with room service , to room keys that dont work , unrefreshed bath towels , forgotten and dirty in-room coffee service , unclean ice bucket overnight , forgotten room cleaning , inability to connect to the Internet ... .I 'm too tired to keep writing all the problems . For the price of this chi-chi downtown hotel , I expect more . Finally , their team is certainly not trained in customer service . The front desk teams have attitudes , and Aria 's hostesses think they are something else . I 'm stuck using this hotel since it is adjoined to Aon , but I would never go back if I had a choice . The only good thing is the food at Aria - outstanding .
Just back from spending Memorial Day weekend in Chicago . We decided to stay at the Talbott , and we reserved a room there over a month ago . I must say that we found the staff to be wonderful , but the accommodations to be quite disappointing . We were given room # 1605 . Avoid this room at all costs ! The adjacent elevator is so noisy that it will keep you awake most of the night ( and then awaken you at 6 AM ) . In addition , we had requested a king bed , and # 1605 has two doubles . We were also surprised that there was no coffee maker in the room . Despite the very friendly staff and its super location , the Talbott was less than what we expected , and we would probably not stay there again .
I believe I can not describe how amazing was our stay at The James . Service was impecable , from the door man to the front desk . Location could not be better . Yes , you can hear the ambulances in the street from the 14th floor , but , come on , you are downtown , what do you expect ... .Overall noise was not in a level to bother us . The only minor incident was a cleaner that tried to open our room to clean at 9 pm ... PM not AM ? Go figure ...
My husband and I decided to take a trip to Chicago at the last minute and quickly chose the Conrad , not really knowing it 's location . We were pleasantly surprised to find it was almost right on Michigan Ave. ( It 's connect to Nordstroms right in the heart of downtown . ) Great for shopping . The hotel itself was fabulous . The staff was extremely helpful in giving suggestions for shows and restaurants . I recommend going to Joe 's that 's right across the street from the hotel . Everyone was raving about it . . .but we could n't get a reservation . The room was wonderful and the bed and pillows were very comfortable . It had a very warm and inviting atmosphere . My husband loved the workout room . I highly recommend the Conrad ! !
If you want to stay in a fabulous hotel in the city and you 're willing to pay a little extra , I 'd recommend this place.Also , pay the extra for a corner room - the views of the city are spectacular.A short walk to Michigan Avenue . Excellent service from the valets , concierge , lobby agents , and waitstaff in the restaurants . The food in the restaurants was great and room service was n't too shabby either.Well worth the money !
Striking architecture is only the beginning of what can only be described as one of the best hotel experiences of my professional life . The attention to detail in the room and the bathroom is remarkable and the bed is the best night 's sleep I 've ever experienced in a hotel . Gorgeous LCD tv and Bose wave machine added to my enjoyment . Sofitel is worth the extra $ 's .
We have been for the first time in Chicago and stayed in the Swissotel for five nights , a wonderful place.Room was on the 29th floor , absolutely clean and nice and a breathtaking lakeview.Breakfast perfect and service really good.People were always helpful.It 's a little bit far from Magnificent mile and the loop , but in front of the hotel there are buses ( number6 ) waiting there next turn , not a real bus stop , but drivers are frindly and you can get on the bus.Next time going to Chicago we will again stay in the Swissotel .
For a supposed 4-star hotel , I was not very impressed at akk . The lobby was nice and modern-looking , but there were no bellhops outside to help with bags or open the doors ( we did n't arrive that late at night ) . Additionally , when we walked into the hotel late one night , there was trash and flowers strewn on the lobby floor and , it seemed that there were always water bottles and glasses near the seating area as you walked in . Where was the staff to clean up ? That 's not a very welcoming sight . The rooms were nice and clean and provided a great view , but the actual location was farther than I would have preferred from Michigan Avenue , andi it was also a little too far south . Area recommendations Rush Street was a lot of fun at night !
My sister and I stayed on the 22nd floor , there was a refrigerator in the hallway for the first three nights , beat up and old dorm style . It was not until we told the concierge that we were going to post the picture we took of it on Tripadvisor did the thing get removed . Breakfast dishes left outside rooms will stay on the floor for a day or two routinely . All night there are chimes that make noise , that are supposed to be comformting or relaxing and rather they are just annoying . There is no wifi - no matter what they tell you , I paid for the wifi , and still we were unable to get on . Lastly , my sister and I split the bill , I had already paid for the first night in form of a deposit and they gave her the credit . Room cost with city taxes etc . was 313.69 a night . I know the Comfort Inn just a few blocks away is significantly cheaper ! So while the View was wonderful , it is NOT worth the money .
This was our third trip to Chicago this year ( we LOVE the city ! ) - every time we stay at a different downtown hotel . Swissotel was definitely our favourite . When we come back in July to see the play `` Wicked '' for the second time , we will be again at Swissotel . No more need to try other hotels ! The location is good because it is between the financial district and the Magnificent Mile . The room was spotless and quiet , the view amazing and those elevators were so fast . Comfortable beds , friendly service , not as many noisy sirens ! We even watched the Navy Pier fireworks from our bed ! This was the best anniversary ever . We would recommend Swissotel to everyone !
We stayed here because of all the great reviews , and it 's all true . We were highly impressed with the high quality of everything , everyone , and the location . Walking distance to much of what Chicago has to offer . Gibson 's steakhouse and the Hancock building to name a couple . This hotel should really be in the top ten or even top five hotels for Chicago . It should also have more than three stars . I mean three stars is for the hilton garden inn or marriott courtyard , and this place far exceeds chain hotels like those . Depending on the room you get , any price under $ 250 would be a good deal . Between 250 - 300 could still be worth it .
After reading the reviews & getting an excellent rate through travelzoo , I decided to give this hotel a try . I must say it was a great choice ! The location is perfect , just off from N Michigan Ave , walking distance from everything . The staff was very helpful and friendly , and the room was excellent . They gave us a corner room w/a great view . As many have posted , the bed & pillows were very comfortable ( I am very picky about that ) . I slept well every night ! The renovation is almost done & did not bother us one bit . I highly recommend this hotel .
I stayed here for business and loved it . Got it for $ 93 inc tax on Priceline , an incredible deal for this hotel . If I was n't on priceline I would expect to pay $ 200 per night ( maybe more ) for this location/level of service . It 's in the heart of downtown Chicago , walkable to many locations . The lobby is very impressive , the room was very nice . No complaints at all , from check-in to check-out . I was alone so did n't go to the bar but it looked like people were really enjoying themselves . It was full of people all the time . I want to stay here when I come back with my husband for a fun weekend in the city .
Firtly they took $ 372 off my card , even though they also took the same amount off of one of my friends for staying an extra night . They had no business taking the money off of my card . So on the 28th Sep I contacted them and they admited to the mistake . It is not a month later and I have called them about 6 times in all and they have still not paid it back . Secondly I booked 8 rooms at buy 2 get 3rd room free direct with hotel . When I looked a week later , they had only booked 7 and refused to offer me the rate 3rd room free rate , so two of my friends did n't come to the trip away . Thirdly I asked if the initial money for all rooms could be taken ASAP as the dollar was weak against the pound . After about 8 phone calls over 5 months ( each saying they would ) they eventually took the money and the whole trip cost an additional PS150 . Overall , the hotel was nice and in a nice location , but I will never be staying there again due to all my problems .
Beautifully appointed , professionally staffed , comfortable , well-located , and elegant , with wireless internet access ( plus free access in an alcove on the second floor ) , fitness center ( a little small but fine if you use it at the right time ) , good energy clientele , easy access to Michigan Avenue , next door to 24-hour restaurant , 2 blocks from 2 Starbucks , elevators that are there before you get your finger off the button - they thought of everything . Will definitely return !
My daughter and I were in Chicago for one night after having attended a three-day conference elsewhere in Illinois . We were only in Chicago on our way home . We did n't know where to stay in Chicago , but booked one night at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers based on their ad in the Chicago Visitors Guide . We 're glad we did ! We enjoyed our stay very much . Our room was very comfortable and well appointed and had a wonderful view of the city . That 's what we wanted -- a great view , and we got it . Also , the hotel is within walking distance of many attractions and is accessible from the bus stop ( we took the train and bus from the airport into the city and it was n't bad -- saved us a lot of money ) . The elevators to our room were fast and quick and there was one always available . We found the front desk staff to be friendly and accommodating . The only downside for us is that we had only booked one night in Chicago . We wish we could have stayed there at the Sheraton for at least another night . We would definitely stay there again .
We live down the block from the hotel . We arranged to have new floors put in our condo while we were away . The floors were not finished when we returned so we looked for an inexpensive local hotel for one night . I think the Ambassador East was the least expensive hotel within a reasonable distance so we decided to stay there . Over the years I had had some visiting groups stay there . I had also eaten there and been to the bar but I had never stayed there myself . The lobby is elegant . The service is great and the room was large and clean although a little outdated . The location is the best residential area in the city ( as far as I am concerned -- I live two blocks away ) and it is very convenient to North Michigan Avenue ( a good shopping street ) and reasonably convenient to the Loop ( the main business area ) There are also probably 50 restaurants in all price ranges in reasonable walking distance including some of the best in the city . I paid less than $ 100 including tax for one night . I am not sure what their regular rates are but I think my deal was the best travel bargain around .
I stayed at the Allegro in July for 4 nights for a business trip . The room was spotlessly clean and the bed was great . I had read reviews that said the bathrooms were tiny , but ours was perfectly fine , with funky , fun doors . The decor is a lot of fun . We were on the 15th floor and there was absolutely no street noise . The front desk staff was very friendly , and before we even made it to the desk , a lovely man took our bags and brought them up to our room within moments of our arrival . We were within walking distance to all the theaters and even walked one night all the way to Navy Pier . For people who were upset about no free coffee - there 's a Dunkin Donuts about a block away . I definitely recommend this hotel !
Great , awesome service . Seriously , the people are amazing . That , and the nice bartender who serves after last call ( at least , that 's what I was told - I of course do n't drink ) save this place from one star . But seriously blah , small , non-luxury rooms with beds that are just really uncomfortable - and for a card rate of $ 725/night , even in a major city , the rooms better be awesome . I 've had waaaay better rooms in NYC for $ 350/night . ( Good thing I had a corporate rate . ) And my room was not especially big , despite what the below reviews say . But here 's the main problem . Even on the 10th floor , the guy blowing the whistle to summon cabs downstairs woke me up at 6 , and 6:15 , and 6:30 , and 6:45 , and 6:50 , and 6:55 , and ... and , well , I finally got up and said screw it , let 's greet the day . Maybe everyone else was already up , but somehow I doubt it . Am now safely ensconced in the Four Seasons .
I stay at this hotel 2 times a year on business and LOVE it ! The staff are great , the rooms are spacious and clean , and the location is perfect for shopping and dining on Michigan Ave. Plus if you sign up for Omni Select Membership ( for free ) you get free wireless internet access .
Beautiful historic hotel -- and since I 'm in historic building business , was looking forward to stay . Moved rooms on second night because of loud party in adjacent suite , they escorted me to a room that was completely torn up -- duct work torn apart in bathroom , lamp fixtures literally falling off wall , mirror torn off wall , etc . Ended up in a room on 20th floor -- much nicer , but yesterday waited 10 minutes for elevator on two separate occasions . Only two of three elevators to top floors work -- and these two elevators skip floors , so you can be stuck waiting for ever . When I raised this to hotel staff , was told this was an old hotel and basically to stuff it . Umm , no . This is not an old building problem , this is a fixable elevator problem if anyone cared enough to fix it . Thumbs way down , stay away . Go to the Drake or Knickerbocker if you 're looking for old world charm , sans hassle .
My husband and I were in the Fairmont Chicago recently for a conference . We stayed in a spacious suite . All amenities appeared recently updated and in excellent shape . The bed was very comfortable . Views were great . I love their products in the bathroom and used them in the pristine tub two out of three nights . The room was so quiet , it was very relaxing . We ate in the restaurant downstairs ( Aria ) and although pricey , it was excellent . The staff were consistently attentive and responsive . It is evident that everyone is very well-trained . I would love to stay here again .
I arrived at the Sofitel for a joint leisure and business . It is a fantastic hotel and made the trip very memorable . The rooms are spacious , great beds , pillows and linen . The bathroom has a great shower and bath . WiFi works really well and the desk is large . The staff are wonderful . The location is great for shopping , spa 's , Starbucks and hairdressers . I loved every minute of it and would not hesitate to stay there again or recommend it .
The room was dingy and run down - it felt like staying in a cheap motel . The carpet was exceptionally worn , wallpaper peeling , bathroom grout dingy . The place felt like it had n't been redecorated in 30 years . On top of that , the windows would not open ( not unusual for a hig-rise hotel ) , and there was no air fan for ac or heat - how the temp control was supposed to work , I have no idea ( they said 'radient cooling ' whatever that is ) , but we had to call down to the front desk and ask for a floor fan to cool the room and have some air circulation . We even went so far as to prop the door open and put the fan in the fan in the door while we were in the room to not feel suffocated . So much for privacy . I ca n't comment on the food , because we ate out at every chance . Chicago has some fantastic food ! And much of it within easy distance to the hotel . The hotel is in a good location , near the waterfront and millenium park , shopping and dining . The conference facilities were average , but frustrating because they were in the basement and cell phone reception was non-existent . I will never stay in this hotel again , especially for the price , because of the poor room quality .
I loved this hotel - reasonable for downtown Chicago , an older hotel with a great reno ( a bit over-the-top design , but still very lovely and charming ) , clean rooms , and very friendly staff . They 're also amazingly pet-friendly - they welcomed our 130lb Mastiff cross with a gift bag ( treats and directions to an off-leash area ) , and even had a cute blackboard with visiting dog 's names on it .
October 3rd , 2007 My wife and I stayed at The Sofitel toward the end of September 2007 . The hotel is VERY modern . The room was immaculate , but the furiture looked as though it came from IKEA . It was chipped in many places . The light switches were difficult to find , and the HVAC made noise . However , the bed was wonderful . The bathroom was large and well maintained . Housekeeping brought us as many towels as we wanted . The restaurant was small . You can eat for less at a 24 hour restaurant around the corner called Tempo . If you want a truly great breakfast try The Peninsula Hotel . However , after dining there you might not want to return to The Sofitel . Prior to checking in we had paid for everything in full . When we checked in , we were asked to leave a credit card for incidentals . Upon returning home , we discovered that although the credit card had not been used the Sofitel had an authorization placed on it . This reduced the line of credit , and it took several days to be removed from the card . Great location ! Reasonable value . If you have a Privilege Card they allow you to check out at 4pm as opposed to 12 in the afternoon .
My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in March , 2006 . We had a great time ! We were upgraded to a suite , and enjoyed the jacuzzi tub with Mr . Bubbles , animal print robes , and a luxurious king- sized bed ! THe suite was very nice , and we had no problem with noise from other rooms or from the street . It was very boutiquey , and the lobby was lovely . We enjoyed the complementary wine hour . The staff was attentive , and our stay in this Kimpton hotel made our first-time trip to Chicago memorable ! We would return here !
My wife and I stayed here for a long weekend and it was great . The check-in staff changed our room to a single bed without question , and the bar served the best martini I have had in a while . The rooms were well decorated and spacious , although it did get a little tight through the bathroom door . The bell staff was very accomodating and walked my wife up to our room when she arrived late . I would definitely stay here again !
This was a great place to be ! Great views of river and lake , walk to everything , a clean and comfortable room , and very accommodating staff . We arrived early and were checked in by 10:30 am and checked out late , effectively adding two days to our vacation . It is a large hotel but the staff works hard and takes good care of the customers .
Stayed here with friends for a long weekend in August and loved the hotel . Enjoyed the free nightly wine happy hour , and the accomodations were quite nice ( our beds were very soft and comfortable ) . We had excellent views of the river from our rooms . The location was wonderful for seeing the sights around town , with easy access to public transportation nearby . My friends actually received the goldfish upon request , which they enjoyed . Some noise could be heard from rooms nearby or above , but it was minimal . Price seemed very resonable to us for the location . Will certainly return to the Windy City and plan on staying here again .
Move beyond the rock theme and it 's an average hotel with a good location . Room was unbearably hot and the controls on the wall did nothing . Thank goodness the window opened or we 'd have been cooked alive . That of course let in all the noise from Michigan Ave . This combined with our neighbors door slamming against their thrown door lock every 30 seconds made for a lively setting . Room was stuffy too . Burn marks on carpet lead me to believe nasty smokers had occupied room on many occasions . Wife happy w/ Aveda in bath . Base bar was good with great service and well made drinks tho pricey .
In my experience the Ambassador hotel did n't seem to be a 3 1/2 star establishment . The building and lobby were nice but the hotel room was extremely dated . The carpeting was very old and worn . The floor - carpeting and tile both seemed dirty which made me very uncomfortable . I would imagine that many years ago this was a very nice hotel . Currently , it 's indespirate need of renovation .
We stayed at the Conrad for 2 nights for a friends reunion . The room was clean and new feeling , nice city view , free bottled water in room upon arrival . Check in was a breeze , and our room was ready even though we were several hours early . All staff was friendly and helpful , excellent breakfast .
While I had stayed in the Hotel Monaco before , this was my husband 's first trip to Chicago and I insisted we stay here as I loved it the first time . Well the second stay was even better -- we had one of the corner suites on the river -- the service was excellent and staff was very friendly and helpful . The warm cookies in the afternoon is a nice touch after a day of sightseeing . Unfortunately we missed the wine hour . One thing that realy impressed me is that b/c of flight delays we got to Chicago a day late -- Hotel Monaco manager waived the cost of the first night on our room even though it was a guaranteed reservation .
This hotel is rather stupid to be frank . It 's a horrible attempt to be retro-sheek but ends up looking similar to that Saturday Night live skit where things are so sheek that they are not functional . The rooms are about the size of a shoe box and there is n't much in them . I actually like the Pedestal in the bathroom but there is no sink . I had to put my make-up on using the toliet for 5-days . It also took me 10-minutes to figure out how to turn on the shower and the bathroom is more like a closet then anything . I had guests over one evening and everyone could hear everyone pee b/c the bathroom doors are n't doors at all and there is no bathroom fan ! It was just over the top for me and lots of costruction nearby to keep you up at night . On a good note , the staff are really friendly and the place is really clean . That 's about the only good thing I can say about this place . I would not go back .
I expected a glamorous room and I walked into a disappointment . Housekeeping and Management must not be concerned with attention to detail at this hotel . If you like staying somewhere that the air in the rooms does n't go down past 74 , the closet is 24 '' wide , all old/dirty brass fixtures , beds that are a little bigger than a twin , showerheads that barely put out water , then this is your hotel . I might be spoiled by staying in Marriott 's , but I stay in hotels 1/3 of the year and was severly disappionted . No free breakfasts or a room change will get me to stay here again .
After checking out of the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower the other day , I left the hotel , crossed the street and started to walk EB on Chestnut while looking for a cab . I was still within sight of a Sofitel doorman when I sighted a cab approximately one block away and attempted to hail same . After doing so , I immediately heard a Sofitel doorman yelling for me to stop and then heard the sound of his whistle . As the cab slowed to pick me up , the doorman continued to yell at me and blow his whistle as he started to run in my direction . When the cab stopped , I quickly entered cab and locked the door for fear of being physically attacked by the Sofitel doorman . After locking the door , the doorman attempted to open the door as he continued to accost me from outside of the cab . After claiming that he had hotel customers waiting for cabs , he suggested that I had no right to hail a cab in the vicinity of the hotel and then called me a `` jerk '' before allowing the cab driver to depart to my destination . Consequently , unless you enjoy being accosted by hotel doormen , please do n't attempt to hail a cab anywhere near the hotel under any circumstances without first securing the permission of a doorman . Lastly , as for the rest of my stay , you will enjoy this hotel if you seek a highly pretentious staff who prefer to speak to guests in French instead of English . While I have nothing against the French or French language , I much prefer communicating in English when visiting one of the best cities in the best country in the world . Viva la USA !
My sister and I went to Chicago for a weekend and decided to stay at this hotel because I have a friend who works at Homewood Suites here in Cleveland so we got a discount . The valets were really friendly , you get in and out service when you pay for parking with the hotel . Check-in is on the 6th floor because there are restaurants beneath the hotel at street level . That also made finding the hotel tricky because I expected a groove to pull into and it turned out that I just had to pull over to the right side of the street . The lady at the front desk was friendly and informative . Our room was very clean . The fact that it is an extented stay hotel was nice when it came to bringing home leftovers from restaurants , storing and reheating food . The complimentary breakfast was great ! They have real food such as eggs , bacon , french toast , cereal , bagels , juice , milk , and yogurt . The hotel is in walking distance from everything and there is a trolley that goes to Navy Pier and passes by Michigan Avenue . They also have free WiFi . Overall , I would definately stay here again and I would recommend it to others .
my husband and l stayed here after a very hectic week in new york . The room was very spacious and clean , the bed was huge and extremely comfortable . I really liked the Aveda bathroom products , great smell . We had room service the first night and it arrived really quick and piping hot . Compliments to the chef . The concierge was very helpful as we needed to find a few places and we were meeting up with friends and did not know how to get to Navy pier , directions were given to us accompanied by a map . The weekend we were there it was their annual air and navy show , this was spectacular . The whole of the last day of the show we spent at Navy pier and the Millenium park . Location of the hotel is very good for most things especially shopping . If we are ever in Chicago again we will definately stay here .
The only minus for this hotel is they do not provide the free morning coffee at all the other Kimpton hotels . It was a great place to stay for the theater but our rate did say morning coffee . The robes were not in the room and it took a long time ( hours ) but other than that a great place . The concierge was excellent .
Arrived at 1:30am only to find that sleep was not in my future because of the dance club connected to the hotel . If you party and stay out all night anyway , this hotel would be fine . But do n't plan to get any rest if the club is open ! Front desk lady was extremely rude to people calling in to inquire about the hotel while I was checking in . She was fine with me and gave me a corner room , but sure would n't want to be on her bad side .
Check ins went smoothly . But be advised ... . Walls are super thin , the building is old and the rooms are very very very small . The downside of them allowing pets was that we could hear the poor dog barking in the morning probably because it needed to go out . For the price it was n't bad . It was walking distance to most major attractions . Overall ... it 's ok at best . Another plus is the CTA is close by .
We stayed 2 nights over spring break in what was called a Jr Suite but resembled a wide hallway with a window at one end . Bad cheap furniture , carpet that stops short of reaching the wall , a TV that sticks out into the middle of the room and a window that whistled when the wind blew . BAD BAD experience . Find aother hotel plenty in the area .
This is a great hotel but there is no way that I would recommend it until the construction around it is complete . The elevator is the alley starts for the construction site behind at 5:30am and goes on into the night . Dumpster filling and emptying also seems to go on 24/7 . Worst of all , the restaurant is open to the sidewalk cafe here and the rats go scampering from the construction next door to street to grating . Ugh !
I had requested a quiet room several weeks in advance , yet was given a room facing the street from which I could hear traffic noise . I asked to be moved and was told that nothing was available until the next day . The next morning , prior to being moved to a quiet room , the toilet in my original room overflowed creating a large unsanitary flood . About an hour later I was moved to a room which did not face the street . The room was quiet but smaller and darker . The mattresses in each room were very firm , I would even say hard . I asked if any softer mattresses were available and was told that the mattresses were all the same . At checkout I tried to give the hotel a form of payment that differed from the card the room was reserved under , and this process was still not done correctly after 10 minutes , which seemed longer because the van to the airport was waiting right outside , with other passengers . ( The cost was not correctly charged until almost a week later . ) As recompense for the noise , flood , etc. , the hotel offered exactly nothing . Not a great stay .
The Good LOCATION Views Decor Room Service Friendly Staff The Bad Shower curtain in replacement room was too short and leaked Bed was just Ok The Ugly Had to pack our bags again and change rooms after loud noises from the elevator kept us up . I am a heavy sleeper but even with my white noise app cranked on the hotel 's iPod dock it was still loud enough to keep me up . Also our toilet leaked into a puddle by the shower . The staff did however provide a replacement room although not immediately . Also , they mentioned that they had AREADY been aware of the noise problem with that room from past customers .
On our visit to Chicago , we chose the Hyatt due to its location in downtown , within walking distance to most major attractions , such as Sears Tower , Magnificent Mile , Grant/Millenium Parks , etc . Subway & bus stops very close by to travel to other locations in the city . Overall the hotel was very nice , clean , and at a great location . Was in a safe area . Went to beautiful Wrigley Field and Soldier Field and saw both teams play . I love Chicago and would defenitely stay here again !
We stayed at the Omni between Christmas and New Year 's in 2008 just to get away for a few days . We found it through web deals and got a penthouse suite very cheap . So this year we checked online just a day or so after Christmas and the deal was there again . It also included parking at the great price . Huge suite overlooking downtown Chicago . Best location to walk EVERYWHERE . My 12 and 11 yr olds loved swimming at night and the chocolate cookies on their pillows . Ca n't wait to go back .
Apart from the location , great , but it stops there . Upon check-in , I was informed I would have a queen bed . I asked for a king size bed , and I was told there would be a charge for going up to a king . GIVE ME A BREAK , a surcharge for going from a queen to a king . When I got up to the room , it was like a oven . I could not get the air to work and needed to call twice before getting service . Everything in the room had a charge associated to it , even down to the coffee , $ 1.00 . Now what 's up with that ? I was very disappointed in the size of the bathroom . Very small . I have stayed there twice and with so many other options , I feel this will be my last .
I just enjoyed a 3-day weekend at the Swissotel Chicago . A friend of mine booked it and got a GREAT rate . Cheaper than even a fleabag motel . So keep an eye out for specials . The view was great , the location was prime . The staff was helpful . The room was large ( we had 2 double beds ) . I only have one complaint . Our room was next to some sort of storage or mechanical room where employees ( I think ) would sneak off to talk on the phone . The sound came right though the vent in our bathroom and we could hear them plain-as-day . Fortunately , the sound was only in the bathroom so it was n't like it kept us up at night . It was just a little weird . Overall , a great stay and I will definitely stay there again .
I stayed @ Affinia for one night on a purpose not to drive all the way from NW suburbs to Women 's hospital oir my surgery . Few things I really did n't enjoy - I could hear noise from outside all night long as well as inside noise from slamming doors.No noise insulation at all ! Very dusty between window frames ( I understand - cars , pollution ) but it looked like it was n't cleaned for a very long time.One more thing really made me upset - broken blinds on a right side . I was unable to pull them down to enjoy my sleep time ... We did n't notice the problem until very-very late.The Affinia hotel serving tourists and guests of Chicago as well as Northwestern Hospital patients and their families - which really need extra privacy and comfort ! Strange but every hotel I stayed @ was supplied with the SEALED roll of toilet paper.Affinia did n't even offer that.Looked like someone used a bathroom right after it was taking care of by a cleaning lady ! Neither toilet paper nor toilet seat were sealed for us to use ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Hopefully , no more surgeries for me ... Wo n't stay @ this place for leisure - even with discount !
Attended a conference at the Palmer House and it truly surpassed my expectations . I had no idea it would be so large , so nice and with so many amenities . I also did n't realize that it is just around the corner from Milenium Park and the Art Institute . We were met at the door by the friendliest staff . Even with a long line at check-in , the entire process was about 10 minutes . We enjoyed the room with the up-to-date TV , decent size bathroom and comfortable bed . Had a fantastic breakfast buffet as well as a delicious take-out lunch at the main restaurant . Paid $ 200/night through the conference which seemed quite fair considering downtown Chicago . We have stayed at the Sofital which is much more upscale , but we also paid over $ 300/night there .
I have stayed at the Palmer a half dozen times in the past and it has been ok . The main drawbacks are the check in desk is always slow and they charge you to use the fitness center , which is truly annoying . In addition , there are so many rooms you often have to walk a hundred years to find your room once you get off the elevator . Other than that , it is a classic old hotel with some yesteryear charm . But , the room they gave me most recently was so small it was laughable . The door to the bathroom could not open as it hit the desk , and the chair to the desk could not be properly pulled out as it hit the bed . There was no room for them to put the TV in front of the bed , so they shoved it off to the side . Room 23242 makes prison cells seem roomy and I promise that no one who works there would ever put someone they know in this hovel . It should not be sold as a hotel room .
My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming . When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum . I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool , one white phone and one emergency red phone , to call the desk . Both were out of service ! ! ! ! I am glad there was n't an emergency . As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean ... . never heard back .
My husband and I were very excited to be staying at the Conrad , unfortunately , we would never stay in this hotel again . The rooms looked nice , but the closer you look there was mold in the bathroom and red stains that looked like dried blood near the sink . The room service cost was super high - costing us over $ 100 for 1 burger , 1 order of french toast , 2 pops and 2 desserts . In the middle of the night the pipes in our room made a very loud vibrating noise which kept us awake . We called the front desk and it took almost 40 minutes for someone to walk over to our room ( we were on the 5th floor , same as the reception desk ) . They did nothing to fix it and the same thing continued the following night and anytime the room above us or to the right used their shower . The staff was friendly enough , but NOT helpful and they did nothing to try and make our stay better with all of the problems . There was not even a coffee pot in the room . Definitely would NOT stay here again for the price . NOT worth it !
Had a week long stay at the Hilton on south Michigan while attending a meeting . The hotel has some elegance in the lobby , meeting rooms and lounges - the hotel rooms could definitely use updating . I would definitely say that for the price of a room here - the rooms should be top notch . My car was misplaced during valet parking , our reservations were messed up , hotel staff showed up repeatedly throughout the week at our door with items ( room service , a new coffee pot , laundry ) that was n't ours . I would not stay at this property again . There are much better places for the money in close proximity to Michigan Ave . It is a very big hotel and at times it felt like we were staying at Faulty Towers .
If you love Brick Walls and Alleyways , then this view is for you . I asked for a room facing the river , I get a room facing a Brick Wall . That really pissed me off . From all the great reviews , I was expecting better . Before I came here , I stayed in a Hyatt in NYC , and that was awesome . There was nothing about the hotel that blew me away . The wine hour was ok . I was hoping there would be something better food , but I guess that 's why it 's a wine hour . I ordered room service one night . There was n't really anywhere to eat it , so I had to eat it on my bed to watch tv . This was my first time coming to Chicago , and I think it will be my last . Just thoroughly disappointed .
Booked a room w/ a queen bed for 2 nights for a wonderful NYE , and was rather disappointed . Bed was either the world 's smallest queen , or was actually a double , not to mention it was uncomfortably springy . Some of the things in the bathroom had been previously opened and used ( q-tips ) . Lots of noise seemed to carry through the vents as we could hear other rooms rather clearly . When the tv was off , there was a very audible high-pitched humming noise that we could not get rid of unless we unplugged the tv . Hot water was very inconsistent in the shower . It is in a great location , however , next time I will try one of the other hotels in the area like the Intercontinental or Marriott . This might not be too bad if you are passing though quickly on business , but I would n't recommend it for a romantic night or two .
Stayed there three nights from 4/17/09 through 4/20/09 . Chechecked in about 9:15 AM . Had to wait about 15 minutes because of specials requests I had made . Room was quiet , and comfortable . Marked improvement over last time I stayed there ( about 5 years ago ) . The renovations were great , and maintained the old time charm of the hotel .
